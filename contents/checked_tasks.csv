However, the amount might be justifiable due to multiple allowable multipliers and special circumstances (severe weather and urgency of travel) mentioned in the Amendment Regarding Travel Expenses.","The expense of $3,800 may comply with the contract conditions under certain circumstances. Given the trip to Iceland during winter, the following adjustments might apply: 
1. Severe weather conditions: Additional allowance up to USD 300 per trip (section 4.6.1).
2. Peak season location adjustment: Multiplier of 1.2 (Amendment 1.1, Seasonal and Location-Based Adjustments) which increases the base cap to USD 3,000.

Using these adjustments, the following calculation can be made:
